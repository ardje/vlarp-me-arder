Vlarp-me-arder just continuously update neighbour arp caches with our mac address.
This can be useful in the following circumstances:
1-IP address failover: the neigbours are harassed with the correct mac-address,
so even recovering from split brains is no problem.
2-Mac (and ip) address failover: combined with macvlan's or arp_ignore setting
8, we've got ourselves a pure L2 failover helper. Use keepalived or vrrpd for
master-slave contests.
